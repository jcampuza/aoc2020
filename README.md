# Advent of code 2020

My solutions to advent of code 2020 written in Golang. These solutions are probably terrible non-idiomatic go, so don't necessarily look ðŸ‘€ here for pristine Go.

### Running

To run a given day run the following

```sh
go run DAY_HERE/main.go
```

For example

```sh
go run 01/main.go
```
